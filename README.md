# 🧠 About the Course

Digital Logic Design is a foundational course in electrical and computer engineering that covers the principles of digital systems. Topics typically include:

Boolean algebra and logic simplification

Logic gates and combinational circuits

Karnaugh maps and circuit minimization

Sequential circuits like flip-flops, counters, and registers

Hardware description languages and simulation tools 
Scribd

The labs in this repo are designed to reinforce these theories with practical implementation and problem solving.
