# 🧠 About the Course

Digital Logic Design is a foundational course in electrical and computer engineering that covers the principles of digital systems. Topics typically include:

- Boolean algebra and logic simplification

- Logic gates and combinational circuits

- Karnaugh maps and circuit minimization

- Sequential circuits like flip-flops, counters, and registers

The labs in this repo are designed to reinforce these theories with practical implementation and problem solving.
